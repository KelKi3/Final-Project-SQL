# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

The objective of this project is to utilize the SQL skills acquired in the recent weeks in order to demonstrate proficiency in data extraction, cleaning, transformation and analysis while developing and implementing a quality assurance process.

## Process

1. Import csv files into pgAdmin for data exploration and cleaning (as per cleaning_data.md)

2. Analyze and make use of the provided data in order to solve the given tasks, while enhancing proficiency in SQL. 
(See starting_with_questions.md and starting_with_data.md)

4. Develop a quality assurance process. (See QA.md)


## Results

The provided data gives insights into visitor behavior, observations on revenue generation and transaction trends and product related metrics.

Visitor Behavior:

-By analyzing the channel grouping data, we can discern the most utilized channels for traffic, enabling us to refine marketing strategies.

-The data on traffic based on geographic location, particularly city and country data, allows us to understand regional patterns of site use.

-Studying visitor patterns based on time and date allows us to compare activity and spending on a monthly, yearly, or daily basis.

Revenue:

-Calculating the average revenue generated per visitor, city, or country over different timeframes, provides a comprehensive understanding of revenue generation on an ongoing basis.

-Identifying patterns that correlate to increased revenue generation, such as channel preferences, time of year, and repeat customers, helps optimze revenue strategies.

Insight into product related data:

-Evaluating sales performance per product to focus on high-performing items and identifying opportunities for improvement.

-Comparing product quantities or revenue based on product variants to help identify trends and preferences.


## Challenges 

1. Exploring the data without any context for the values, units of measure, relationship between tables and no where to learn more about it
  
2. Managing the data without being able to set proper unique keys

3. Navigating the amount of duplicated, missing and inconsistent data


## Future Goals

To be able to break down the tables into smaller, more defined data sets with proper primary and foreign keys and to have more clarity with the data so the tasks could be completed with more confidence
